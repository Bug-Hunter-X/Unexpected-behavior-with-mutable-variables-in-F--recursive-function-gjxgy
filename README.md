This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to mutable variables within recursive functions in F#. The `bug.fs` file contains code that exhibits unexpected behavior due to the improper handling of mutable state. The `bugSolution.fs` file offers a corrected version that avoids the issue and provides a more predictable outcome.  The core problem stems from the mutable variables `x` and `y` being updated within the recursive call to `loop`.  The solution demonstrates how to better manage mutable state in recursive functions to avoid unexpected behavior.
